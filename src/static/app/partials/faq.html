  <h4>What is the star rating?</h4>
  <div>
    The star rating is the rating that a user gives to an app when the leave a review.
    It can be between 1 and 5 stars. The average user star rating makes up an app's
    star rating.
    <br/>
    Apps without a star rating have not yet been reviewed.

  <h4>What is the heart rating?</h4>
  <div>
    The heart rating is similar to the star rating, but it rewards apps for having
    more good reivews. An app with more 5 star ratings will have a higher heart
    rating than an app with only a few 5 star ratings.
    <br/>
    Heart ratings are calculated from the star rating where a 5 star review is
    1 heart point, 4 stars = 0.5 hears, 3 stars = 0 hears, 2 stars = -0.5 hears,
    and 1 star = -1 hears.
    <br/>
    It is possible to have a negative heart rating.
